# tw-debug

A tiny LUA debugging utility designed for Total War modding, inspired by [visionmedia/debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug).

It is in fact a direct port to LUA and Total War modding environment.

Tested heavily in the context of Troy modding, but should be supported as well in other Total War games.

## Installation

Simply clone or download this repository and copy the content of the `script` directory to your mod.

## Usage

`debug` exposes a function, simply pass this function the name of your mod, and it will return a decorated version of `out()` for you to pass debug statements to. This will allow you to toggle the debug output for different parts of your mod as well as the mod as a whole.

Example `mod.lua`

 ```lua
local debug = require("tw-debug")("mymod")

debug("Init module")

require("mod/stuff")
```

Example `mod/stuff.lua`

```lua
local a = require("tw-debug")("mymod:stuff:a")
local b = require("tw-debug")("mymod:stuff:b")

local function worka()
    a('doing lots of uninteresting work');
    cm:callback(worka, math.random())
end

local function workb()
    b('doing some work');
    cm:callback(workb, math.random())
end

worka()
workb()
```

The `DEBUG` ini variable is then used to enable these based on space delimited names.

By default, `debug` will write those debug logs to `debug.txt` file, in the current working directory (usually the game base directory, where the .exe is located).

```
mymod Init module +0ms
mymod:stuff:a doing lots of uninteresting work +0ms
mymod:stuff:b doing some work +0ms
mymod:stuff:a doing lots of uninteresting work +488ms
mymod:stuff:a doing lots of uninteresting work +101ms
mymod:stuff:b doing some work +590ms
mymod:stuff:b doing some work +197ms
mymod:stuff:a doing lots of uninteresting work +707ms
mymod:stuff:b doing some work +908ms
mymod:stuff:b doing some work +200ms
mymod:stuff:a doing lots of uninteresting work +903ms
mymod:stuff:b doing some work +502ms
mymod:stuff:a doing lots of uninteresting work +503ms
mymod:stuff:b doing some work +403ms
mymod:stuff:b doing some work +707ms
mymod:stuff:a doing lots of uninteresting work +812ms
mymod:stuff:a doing lots of uninteresting work +97ms
mymod:stuff:a doing lots of uninteresting work +454ms
mymod:stuff:b doing some work +856ms
mymod:stuff:b doing some work +404ms
mymod:stuff:b doing some work +203ms
mymod:stuff:a doing lots of uninteresting work +914ms
mymod:stuff:a doing lots of uninteresting work +496ms
mymod:stuff:b doing some work +602ms
```

## Configuration

Configuration is done through an ini file `debug.ini`, in the current working directory (usually the game base directory, where the .exe is located).

```ini
# Enables/disables specific debugging namespaces.
DEBUG=*

# Example
# DEBUG=mymod mymod:*
```

`debug` won't log anything unless this file is present, and the debugging namespaces matche one of your debugger names.

## Millisecond diff

When actively developing a mod it can be useful to see when the time spent between one `debug()` call and the next. Suppose for example you invoke `debug()` before invoking a callback, and after as well, the "+NNNms" will show you how much time was spent between calls.

```
mk:temples:mod init +0ms
mk:temples:ui init +0ms
mk:temples:ui buildButtonUIC +4ms
mk:temples:ui registerDropdownButtonsListeners +4ms
mk:temples:ui { "tab_factions", "tab_regions", "tab_units", "tab_events", "tab_missions" } +4ms
mk:temples:ui Register listener for tab_factions +4ms
mk:temples:ui Register listener for tab_regions +4ms
mk:temples:ui Register listener for tab_units +4ms
mk:temples:ui Register listener for tab_events +4ms
mk:temples:ui Register listener for tab_missions +4ms
mk:temples:mod done +41ms
mk:temples:ui onButtonClick +5s
mk:temples:ui buildTemplesDropdownUIC +3ms
mk:temples:data getTemplesData for 47 regions +0ms
```

## Pretty print

The [inspect](https://github.com/kikito/inspect.lua) library is used to pretty print every argument you pass to `debug()`

```lua
local debug = require("tw-debug")("mod:ui")
local buttons = { "tab_factions", "tab_regions", "tab_units", "tab_events", "tab_missions" }
debug(buttons)

debug("==>", { "a", "b", "c", {
  foo = {
    bar = "bar"
  }
}});

--[[ Output

mod:ui { "tab_factions", "tab_regions", "tab_units", "tab_events", "tab_missions" } +0ms
mod:ui ==> { "a", "b", "c", {
    foo = {
      bar = "bar"
    }
  } } +4ms

]]
```

## Conventions

If you're using this in one or more of your mods, you _should_ use the name of your mod so that developers may toggle debugging as desired without guessing names. If you have more than one debuggers you _should_ prefix them with your mod name and use ":" to separate features.

## Wildcards

The `*` character may be used as a wildcard. Suppose for example your mod has debuggers named "mod:ui", "mod:utils", "mod:factions", instead of listing all three with `DEBUG=mod:ui mod:utils mod:factions`, you may simply do `DEBUG=mod:*`, or to run everything using this library simply use `DEBUG=*`.

You can also exclude specific debuggers by prefixing them with a "-" character. For example, `DEBUG=* -mod:*` would include all debuggers except those
starting with "mod:".

## Formatters

Debug uses [printf-style](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string) formatting, through the use of `string.format()`

Below are the officially supported formatters:

| Formatter | Representation |
|-----------|----------------|
| `%s`      | String. |
| `%q`      | String (quoted). |
| `%d`      | Number (integer). |
| `%f`      | Number (float). |
| `%%`      | Single percent sign ('%'). This does not consume an argument. |

[`string.format()`](http://lua-users.org/wiki/StringLibraryTutorial) has more options you can use (like , `%g`)

Between the `%` and the letter, a directive can include other options, which control the details of the format, such as the number of decimal digits of a floating-point number:

```lua
string.format("pi = %.4f", math.pi)     --> pi = 3.1416
```

## Output logs

By default `debug` will log to `debug.txt`, however this can be configured per-namespace by overriding the `log` method.

```lua
local debug = require("tw-debug")("test")
debug.log = function(env, ...)
    --[[ env
    {
        -- the current debug timestamp (as returned by os.clock())
        curr = 3150.4162597656,

        -- the humanized diff between the previous debug call and this one
        diff = "0ms",

        -- the configured namespace for this debugger
        namespace = "test"
    }
    ]]
    
    -- remaining arguments can be retrived with the arg table (use unpack(arg) to call a function with them)
    out("outputs stuff " .. arg[1])
end

-- now goes to script_log.txt
debug("goes to script_log.txt via out()")
```

## Output files

Similarly, if you just want to change the file to which logs are written instead of the default `debug.txt`, this can be configured per-namespace by setting the `file` property.

```lua
local debug = require("tw-debug")("test")
debug.file = "mod_logs.txt"

-- now goes to mod_logs.txt
debug("goes to mod_logs.txt")
```


## Checking whether a debug target is enabled

After you've created a debug instance, you can determine whether or not it is
enabled by checking the `enabled` property:

```lua
local debug = require('tw-debug')('mymod');

if debug.enabled then
  -- do stuff...
end
```

You can also manually toggle this property to force the debug instance to be enabled or disabled.
